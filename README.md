## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- next-themes

### What I learned

This project was key in incremental learning and feeding me with new knowledge on my journey to professional programming:

- Tailwind CSS; General practical use with react.
- Effecting Tailwind CSS dark Mode with next-themes.
- Dynamically change App font with Tailwind CSS.
- Typescript; General practical use and why the industry swears by it.
- Proper use of useParams in Next.js.
- Not all States/Functions need be global. Very ok to create them in modular format on a per need basis.
- External "audio" HTML element use, and proper error handling when "fetching".

### Continued development

- Open Source and Technical Writing to get that needed work experience for the job hunt!
